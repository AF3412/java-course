Java Professionals Course
-----------------

Unfortunately many Java engineers don't really get programming even after several years of experience. 
This course intends to open eyes on what software engineering actually is and how to write high quality
software. It's for you if:
 
- You've written at least 1 app with HTTP and DB (even if it's a pet project)
- You use HTTP but you don't know what verbs are idempotent
- You don't know what thread pools are and how to configure them
- You use declarative transactions but don't know what AOP is
- You work with DB but don't know what connection testing is
- You still write tests that use mocking frameworks

# What you should expect

There are so many libraries and frameworks around that it's impossible to learn them all. Fortunately you don't need to.
We'll be learning basic principles that you can reuse no matter what implementation you choose.

Throughout the course we'll implement a tiny REST app using:

* Maven
* H2, Hibernate, C3P0 
* HibernateValidator
* Spring IoC
* Tomcat, Spring MVC, Jackson2
* Testing: TestNG, Unitils, Qala Datagen, MockMvc, RestAssured

# How much efforts will it take

This is a self-paced course. Find the tasks, tackle them, solve puzzles, answer questions. There are 2 modes, whatever 
fits you:

* Overview - you just go through the course from the beginning to the end reading articles and implementing the app. 
It should take 1-3 months - all is up to you.
* Advanced - for most topics there will be references to the books. You'll read them to fully grasp the topic.

There will be times when you're less interested in a specific topic - feel free to skip it and return later.
