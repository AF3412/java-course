Java Professionals Course
-----------------

This is a puzzle! It should be easy to solve it after 
[Hibernate](https://github.com/qala-io/java-course/blob/master/docs/programme/hibernate.md) part of the course.

There is a failing test that checks that if we violate a DB constraint, an exception is raised. But that doesn't happen.
Looks like the DB constraints don't work. Or do they?

Find the problem and figure out the root cause. Make the test pass.
