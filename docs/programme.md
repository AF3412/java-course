Course Programme
----------------

Within the course you're going to have steps to accomplish - most of them will be reading, practicing. There will be
questions that you should be able to answer (at least to yourself) - please make sure you don't skip this part.

Also there will be even more practical tasks - you'll be presented with the code that doesn't work and your task would 
be to find a fix. 

There will be times when you're less interested in a specific topic - feel free to skip it and return later. But some
parts are connected so it's better to move more or less stepwise.

Final advice: don't go over more than 1 step a day. Learning is not about memorizing - it's about understanding the
concepts. To learn deeply we need some time to process the information in the background. Be slow and thorough - not
quick and shallow.
